<P>Interfaces for compact, extensible, modular and performant histogramming functionality. 
</P>
<h1><a name="Overview"></a>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>
Aida itself offers the histogramming features of HTL and HBOOK, the <em>de-facto</em> 
standard for histogramming for many years. It also offers a number of useful extensions, 
with an object-oriented approach. These features include the following: 
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>creating and filling of 1D, 2D (and profile histograms, in the future)</li>
  <li>computation of statistics such as the mean, rms, etc. of a histogram</li>
  <li>support for operations between histograms (in the future)</li>
  <li>browsing of and access to characteristics of individual histograms</li>
</ul>
<p> File-based I/O can be achieved through the standard Java built-in serialization 
  mechanism. All classes implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface. 
  However, the toolkit is entirely decoupled from advanced I/O and visualisation 
  techniques. It provides data structures and algorithms only. 
<p> This toolkit borrows many concepts from HBOOK and the CERN <a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/HTL"> 
  HTL</a> package (C++) largely written by Savrak Sar.
<p> The definition of an abstract histogram interface allows functionality that 
  is provided by external packages, such as plotting or fitting, to be decoupled 
  from the actual implementation of the histogram. This feature paves the way 
  for co-existence of different histogram packages that conform to the abstract 
  interface. </p>
<p>A reference implementation of the interfaces is provided by package {@link 
  hep.aida.ref}. </p>

<h2>3. Histograms</h2>
<h3>3.1 Axes</h3>
<p>An <i>axis</i> ({@link hep.aida.IAxis}) describes how one dimension of the problem 
  space is divided into intervals. Consider the case of a 10 bin histogram in 
  the range <tt>[0,100]</tt>. An axis object containing the number of bins 
  and the interval limits will describe completely how we divide such an interval: 
  a set of 10 sub-intervals of equal width. This is termed a {@link hep.aida.ref.FixedAxis} 
  and can be constructed as follows </p>
<table>
  <td class="PRE"> 
      <pre>
IAxis axis = new FixedAxis(10, 0.0, 100.0); 
</pre>
  </td>
</table>
It may be required to work with an histogram over the same range as the example 
above, but with bins of variable widths. In this case, an axis containing the 
bin edges will describe completely how the interval <tt>[0,100]</tt> is divided. 
Such an axis is termed a {@link hep.aida.ref.VariableAxis} and can be constructed 
as follows 
<table>
  <td class="PRE"> 
      <pre>
double[] edges = { 0.0, 10.0, 40.0, 49.0, 50.0, 51.0, 60.0, 100.0 };
IAxis axis = new VariableAxis(edges); 
</pre>
  </td>
</table>
An <tt>n</tt>-dimensional histogram thus contains <tt>n</tt> axes, one for each 
dimension. The only concern of an axis is to associate any ordered 1D space with 
a discrete numbered space. Thus it associates an interval to an integer. Hence, 
an axis knows about the width of the intervals and their lower point/bound or 
upper point/bound. An axis can be asked for such information as follows: 
<table>
    <td class="PRE"> 
      <pre>
IAxis axis = new FixedAxis(2, 0.0, 20.0); // 2 bins, min=0, max=20<br>... 
axis.{@link hep.aida.IAxis#bins bins()};          // Number of in-range bins (excluding underflow and overflow bins) 
axis.{@link hep.aida.IAxis#binLowerEdge binLowerEdge(i)}; // and the lower edge of bin i
axis.{@link hep.aida.IAxis#binWidth binWidth(i)};     // and its width
axis.{@link hep.aida.IAxis#binUpperEdge binUpperEdge(i)}; // and its upper edge
double point = 1.23;
int binIndex = axis.{@link hep.aida.Iaxis#coordToIndex coordToIndex(point)}; // Obtain index of bin the point falls into (maps to)
</pre>
  </td>
</table>
<p> In this package, a histogram delegates to its axes the task of locating a 
  bin. In other words, information about the lower and upper edges of a bin or 
  the width of a given bin are obtained from the corresponding axis. This is shown 
  in the following code fragment, which demonstrates how the lower and upper edges 
  and width of a given bin can be obtained. 
<table>
  <tr> 
    <td class="PRE"> 
      <pre>
IHistogram1D histo = new Histogram1D("Histo1D", 10, 0.0, 100.0 ); 
... 
histo.{@link hep.aida.IHistogram1D#xAxis xAxis()}.bins()           // Obtain the number of bins (excluding underflow and overflow bins)
histo.xAxis().binLowerEdge(i)  // and the lower edge of bin i
histo.xAxis().binWidth(i)      // and its width
histo.xAxis().binUpperEdge(i)  // and its upper edge
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>An axis always sucessfully maps any arbitrary point drawn from the universe 
  <tt>[-infinity,+infinity]</tt> to a bin index, because it implicitly defines 
  an additional <i>underflow</i> and <i>overflow</i> bin, both together called 
  <i>extra bins</i>. </p>
<table>
  <td class="LISTING"> 
      <pre>
 IHistogram2D h = new Histogram2D(new FixedAxis(2, 0.0, 100.0), new FixedAxis(2, 0.0, 100.0), ...);

	   y ^                          i ... in-range bin, e .. extra bins
	     |                           
	+inf |                           
	     |   e | e | e | e           
	 100 -  ---------------
	     |   e | i | i | e          --> in-range == [0,100]<sup>2</sup>
	     |  ---------------         --> universe == [-infinity,+infinity]<sup>2</sup>
	     |   e | i | i | e          --> extra bins == universe - inrange
	   0 -  ---------------         
	     |   e | e | e | e          
	 -inf|  
	      -----|-------|------> x
	      -inf 0      100   +inf
</pre>
  </td>
</table>
<p>For example if an axis is defined to be <tt>new FixedAxis(2, 0.0, 20.0)</tt>, 
  it has 2 in-range bins plus one for underflow and one for overflow. <tt>axis.bins()==2</tt>. 
  Its boundaries are <tt>[Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,0.0), [0.0, 10.0), [10.0, 20.0), 
  [20.0, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY]</tt>. As a consequence point -5.0 maps to bin 
  index <tt>IHistogram.UNDERFLOW</tt>, point 5.0 maps to bin index 0, 15.0 maps 
  to bin index 1 and 25.0 maps to bin index <tt>IHistogram.OVERFLOW</tt>. </p>
<p> As a further example, consider the following case: <tt>new VariableAxis(new 
  double[] { 10.0, 20.0 })</tt>. The axis has 1 in-range bin: <tt>axis.bins()==1</tt>. 
  Its boundaries are <tt>[Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,10.0), [10.0, 20.0), [20.0, 
  Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY]</tt>. Point 5.0 maps to bin index <tt>IHistogram.UNDERFLOW</tt>, 
  point 15.0 maps to bin index 0 and 25.0 maps to bin index <tt>IHistogram.OVERFLOW</tt>.
<p> As can be seen, underflow bins always have an index of <tt>IHistogram.UNDERFLOW</tt>, 
  whereas overflow outlier bins always have an index of <tt>IHistogram.OVERFLOW</tt>. 
<h3>3.2 Bins</h3>
<p> Bins themselves contain information about the data filled into them. They 
  can be asked for various descriptive statistical measures, such as the minimum, 
  maximum, size, mean, rms, variance, etc. 
<p> Note that bins (of any kind) only know about their contents. They do not know 
  where they are are located in the histogram to which they belong, nor about 
  their widths or bounds - this information is stored in the axis to which they 
  belong, which also defines the bin layout within a histogram. 
<h2>4. Advanced Histogramming</h2>
TODO. 
<h1><a name="Comparison"></a>Comparison with the old AIDA interfaces</h1>
<h2></h2>
<P>A proposed simpler alternative to the current hep.aida.flat classes.</P>
<P>The classes in this directory have been proposed by Mark Donselmann, Wolfgang 
Hoschek and Tony Johnson as a simpler, easier to use alternative to the classes 
orignally proposed as the AIDA standard. </P>
<P>Our goals were:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Eliminate methods that are primarily for developers 
  writing display packages, they should not be complicating the public user 
  interfaces. 
  <LI>Reduce unnecessary duplication which makes the 
  interfaces very long without adding any additional functionality or 
  ease-of-use 
  <LI> Eliminate methods that are hard to use (we 
  could not think of any occasion where the 8 separate methods for getting the 2D 
  overflows bins would be convenient for anyone).</LI></OL>
Note that 
ease of implementation was <STRONG>NOT </STRONG>a primary goal. 
Following these goals we were able to reduce the number of methods as 
follows:

<TABLE border=1 cellPadding=1 cellSpacing=1>

    <TD>8</TD></TR></TABLE>
<DIV></DIV>The primary differences between the old classes and the new classes 
are: 
<OL>
  <LI>Introduction of an IAxis class, to describe the X 
  axis for 1D histograms, and the X and Y axes of 2D histograms. We understand 
  that the desire is to keep the interfaces as flat as possible, but feel this 
  introduces a significant improvement in terms of reducing complexity, and is 
  an abstraction that is easy for even the most object-phobic physicist to 
  grasp. 
  <LI>We define constants OVERFLOW and UNDERFLOW to 
  represent the underflow and overflow bins on an axis. This eliminates the need 
  for special routines that deal with overflows/underflows. It also improves the 
  interface since it exposes the full set of overflow/underflow bins for 2D 
  histograms. Under the previous proposal it was necessary for the 
  implementation to keep the full set of overflow/underflow bins, in order to be 
  able to do the projections correctly, but there was no way for the end-user to 
  access them (they were restricted to the 8 overflow bins N,E,S,W,NE,SE,SW,NW). 

  <LI>We eliminated the methods which return information 
  about bins based on coordinate (as opposed to index). We felt these functions 
  were rarely used, were in some cases ambiguous (for example when 
  projections/slices were specified in terms of coordinates what exactly was the 
  meaning) and the same functionality with less ambiguity was available by 
  calling coordToIndex() first.</LI></OL>
